# Leibniz Method RESTful Consumer

This project demonstrates how to consume the Leibniz Method RESTful API to calculate the value of π (pi) using a Java application.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arrova2023/-LeibnizMethodRESTfulConsumer.git

    Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse).

    Run the PiCalculationClient class.

    You will be prompted to enter the number of decimal places and the number of iterations for the π calculation.

    The application will send an HTTP POST request to the Leibniz Method RESTful API and display the response in the console.
